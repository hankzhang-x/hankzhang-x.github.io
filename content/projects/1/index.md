## TOPIC

The workshop investigated potential of the Imitation learning, the deep reinforcement learning approach in a computational and fabrication framework to generate a small / middle scale spatial scenario (potentially to be used as an insect hotel or a habitat for birds).

The computational method incorporated a user-defined kit of parts delivered through the Design For Manufacture and Assembly method of production. The framework encompassed human inputs during the process from which the AI will learn its principles and try to reinterpret them in a novel form (either through the cloning or improved imitation) in the digital space. The workshop idea was built on the hypothesis suggesting that unique design provided by a demonstrator (a designer, who is a master builder) could be translated into forms of digital data and processes, and reinterpreted by the AI in an augmented scenario and produced in the fabrication process. The process combines human and artificial intelligence, aiming to address human designers’ intuitive approach to design and consequently imitated and augmented by AI, following the human-in-the-loop method of mutual co-creative interaction.

## Design Scheme


### Digital Gothic: Elliptical Reconfiguration Assembly

<img src="/images/project/1/3.jpg" style="max-width:100%"> </img>


This project presents an interactive art installation that blends generative design with machine learning. Starting from a simple circular form, the shape gradually transforms into a series of elongated ovals—an abstract homage to the evolution of Gothic architecture in classical Europe.


The structure’s fluid curves and dramatic verticality evoke a sense of mystery and grandeur. Behind the form lies a process of learning and iteration: the design is informed by patterns derived from manually recorded data, subtly shaped by digital tools.

As visitors approach, they are drawn in by the shifting geometry, spatial presence, and emotional resonance of the piece. The installation invites them to experience a dialogue between past and future, where art and technology converge to reimagine historical beauty through contemporary expression.
