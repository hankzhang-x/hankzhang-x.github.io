With the rapid rise of drone technologies and Urban Air Mobility (UAM), the tension between urban spatial usage and technological innovation has become increasingly evident. On one hand, cities face growing demands for efficient logistics, aerial traffic management, and immersive application scenarios. On the other, conventional architectural typologies and urban infrastructure are still far from fully accommodating these fast-evolving low-altitude technologies—especially in terms of safety, regulation, and spatial planning.

To meet the diverse needs of the low-altitude economy, architecture must go beyond providing spaces for R&D and testing. It must also offer flexible, reconfigurable environments for drone simulation, flight demonstrations, and public engagement. This calls for a complete rethinking of both internal circulation and external urban interface, aiming to create an open, adaptive platform for technological experimentation within a highly compact city fabric.

At the heart of this design is a question:

### How can we create an architectural platform within the city that evolves with the dynamic nature of low-altitude technologies?

From this inquiry emerges the core concept: “The sky is the city; the city is the sky.”

Guided by this vision, the proposal sets three design goals:

###  Suspended volumetrics，Public interaction and Vertical connectivity
