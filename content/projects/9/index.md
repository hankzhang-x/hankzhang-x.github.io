Harbin Intelligence Valley is a strategic urban design proposal that leverages the academic and research strengths of Harbin Institute of Technology to create a new model for a university-led innovation corridor. Located in the core area surrounding HIT, the project integrates high-tech enterprise incubation, academic collaboration, and ecological living to form a dynamic, future-oriented science and innovation hub.
The site is structured around two complementary zones:

“Intelli-Valley”, a high-tech campus district that fosters talent convergence, R&D translation, and industrial clustering

“Eco-Neighborhood”, a livable urban area shaped by riverside landscapes and green infrastructure, supporting residential vitality and social interaction

The design strategy is driven by four key concepts:

### Intelligence · Converge · Green · Center

These principles guide the integration of technology, ecology, and community to build a smart, resilient, and human-centered innovation ecosystem in cold-climate urban conditions.

By transforming underutilized industrial and academic land into a high-efficiency, mixed-use innovation district, the project aims to position Harbin as a northern engine of China’s knowledge economy.
