## Design Background

With the rapid growth of cloud computing and AI, traditional land-based data centers face mounting challenges in energy consumption and heat dissipation. Emerging underwater data center technologies offer a more sustainable alternative, leveraging seawater for natural cooling and significantly reducing PUE and land usage. However, these systems continuously discharge low-grade thermal wastewater, posing risks of local marine thermal pollution.

At the same time, the marine aquaculture industry is shifting toward deep-sea operations, which demand stable thermal conditions and efficient energy solutions—particularly for high-value species like abalone or tropical fish. By recycling waste heat from subsea data centers to support controlled aquaculture environments, we envision a closed-loop synergy between energy, ecology, and economy.

This project explores a self-sufficient oceanic system driven by underwater data centers, integrating energy flow, information flow, and marine production into a four-dimensional circular model. The core concept:

### "Dual-Driven, Fourfold Loop" — connecting data infrastructure, marine farming, scientific research, and service industries into a sustainable, co-evolving platform.
