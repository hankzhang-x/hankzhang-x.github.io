This bridge is a public-interest infrastructure project located in Liugaoshou Village, Daqing. Collaborating with students from the transportation and bridge engineering discipline, we designed a solution for a critical traffic node urgently needed by the local community.

Our proposal balanced economic feasibility with ecological sensitivity, addressing both functional connectivity and environmental integration. The project was recognized with the “Outstanding Practice Award” for its social impact and design effectiveness.
