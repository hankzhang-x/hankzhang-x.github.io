## Design Description

The concept of the plan is "The Loop." The primary structure is transformed from a one-dimensional closed topology line into two interconnected and overlapping loops, forming an inner and outer loop. The outer loop mainly houses the market, symbolizing traditional Armenian culinary techniques and cultural heritage. The inner loop features modern shops, representing contemporary and new-age cooking technologies and methods. At the intersection of the two loops, there are cooking laboratories and experimental shared canteens and specialty shops operated by students. This design utilizes modern culinary techniques to innovate upon traditional cooking culture.

To enliven the atmosphere of the farmers' market and provide an intuitive guide to the diversity of agricultural products, colorful product images were extracted from local vendors. These images were pixelated and fragmented to inspire the graphics and color palette of the market canopy, creating a vibrant visual identity that reflects the richness of both the produce and the culture.
