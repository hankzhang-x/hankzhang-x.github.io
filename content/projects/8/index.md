## Company Introduction

OpeNeuro is a forward-looking startup positioned at the intersection of neural signal decoding and next-generation AI models. In the era of foundation models, while global giants like OpenAI and Google Gemini are rapidly advancing in language, vision, and motion domains, neural signals—an essential yet underexplored modality in human-machine interaction—remain largely untapped. YuanQing aims to pioneer this frontier, striving to become the “OpenAI of neural signals”.

Aligned with China’s national development goals and the 14th Five-Year Plan, OpeNeuro focuses on transforming neural signal technology into new productive forces. The company’s core platform, OpenNeuro, supports a scalable neural signal ecosystem across three major verticals: data acquisition, signal decoding, and interactive application. By anchoring its first application in the sports and wellness industry, YuanQing addresses high-potential markets such as neurorehabilitation, brain-computer interaction, and smart sports analytics.

With innovation at its core, OpeNeuro is committed to shaping a new era where neural intelligence bridges human potential and machine capability—unlocking transformative possibilities for health, science, and society.

The project was showcased at the Zhongguancun International Conference Center and received strong recognition from multiple top-tier venture capital firms. The Director of the Beijing Municipal Development and Reform Commission expressed high-level support, encouraging the rapid advancement of the project.

#### Additionally, the project received a 5-million-RMB investment intent from Dr. Lu Qi, founding partner of MiraclePlus.

## Flagship Products with My Project Manager Role 


###  NeoFit (2023)

NeoFit is our first consumer-facing wearable designed to capture high-quality, labeled EMG (muscle signal) data essential for training large-scale neural models. The patch-style device consists of a rechargeable core module and a disposable adhesive, worn directly on target muscle groups. It tracks muscle activation timing, intensity, and fatigue with high precision during workouts. Paired with a mobile app via Bluetooth, NeoFit provides real-time data visualization and personalized feedback.

### Smart Finger (2024)

Smart Finger is a soft exoskeleton glove for hand rehabilitation, designed to support patients with motor impairments in stroke or injury recovery. It uses a back-mounted motor and elastic tendon system to assist finger flexion and extension, enabling both isolated and coordinated hand movements. The glove supports multiple rehab modes—such as grip training, mirror therapy, and AI-guided exercises—controlled by an onboard processor. Made of breathable elastic fabric, it ensures comfort during extended use. Integrated Bluetooth or Wi-Fi allows remote data tracking and real-time progress monitoring by clinicians, making Smart Finger suitable for both in-clinic and at-home rehabilitation.

### NeuroRehab (2025)

NeuroRehab Core is a wearable upper-limb exoskeleton designed to support muscle recovery and motor rehabilitation through real-time sensing and intelligent assistance. The device uses surface-mounted sensors to detect muscle signals and movement patterns, enabling it to respond to the user’s motion intention with timely and adaptive support.

Lightweight, modular, and easy to wear, NeuroRehab Core helps users engage in more effective rehabilitation training—whether recovering from injury, surgery, or neuromuscular conditions. It translates subtle muscle activity into meaningful motion, making recovery smarter, safer, and more personalized.
