  <p>I’m someone who cares about the relationship between technology and people—and how ideas turn into things that matter. I’m less interested in fixed titles, and more focused on asking the right questions, building real systems, and making them work.</p>
  <p>I move between disciplines, but my core stays the same: to think clearly, build thoughtfully, and take responsibility.</p>
