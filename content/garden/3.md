I’ve come to believe that no one is truly unaware of their natural talents—only that some haven't yet explored enough to discover them. Through years of self-driven experimentation, introspection, and creation, I’ve gradually understood why entrepreneurship is not just an option for me—it’s a way of living that matches how I think, act, and grow.

## 1. Strong Internal Drive
Success in any venture begins with intrinsic motivation. I’m driven by a deep sense of mission, not by the lure of external rewards. I’ve always been captivated by science fiction, future systems, and big ideas—and I’m energized by the possibility of making them real. Whether reading deeply across disciplines, or even playing games to analyze narrative structures and philosophical systems, everything I do tends to serve a larger vision that fuels me.

## 2. Sharp Intuition 
I often sense the direction of trends and technologies well before they become mainstream—an intuition that’s been repeatedly validated over time. I believe this stems from a broad, interdisciplinary foundation in technology and design, cultivated through heavy reading, lectures, and hands-on collaborations. Though I still have more to learn about markets and economics, I’m actively filling those gaps. When I see my thoughts echoed and confirmed by figures like Elon Musk or Sam Altman, it gives me confidence in my judgment—and reminds me I’m thinking along the right lines.

## 3. Risk-Tolerant and Adventure-Oriented

I thrive on uncertainty and challenge. In daily life, I seek experiences that are intense, unpredictable, and transformative. I’m drawn to extreme sports not only for the thrill but because they reflect my comfort with risk and change. I don’t want a life where everything is predictable—I want to build things that didn’t exist before, and that demands a certain appetite for risk that I naturally possess.

## 4. Leadership and Team Experience 
From early on, I’ve taken the initiative to form teams around ideas I care about. In middle school, I started a non-profit tech group that attracted university students, even though we were bound to fail in those conditions. Since college, I’ve led or co-led several entrepreneurial and innovation projects, many of which were highly praised by professors and peers. When working solo—due to lack of aligned collaborators—I’ve still delivered results that often surpassed team projects. I’ve learned to value aligned goals and high standards in collaborators, and in a real startup setting, I believe I can assemble and manage a focused, high-performing team.
## 5. Rapid Iteration and Feedback Adaptability
One of the most valuable traits in a founder is the ability to change rapidly based on feedback. I respect objective reality, even when it contradicts my assumptions. While I can be persistent when I believe in something, I never hesitate to adjust my course when presented with compelling evidence. I constantly self-reflect—asking whether I’m doing the right thing, in the right way. Whether it’s waking up earlier, dropping bad habits, or adjusting my leadership approach, I embrace the idea that growth is a continuous process. People who’ve known me over time often describe me as one of the most transformative individuals they’ve seen—and I take that as a marker of entrepreneurial readiness.
